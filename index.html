      <p class="description">
        Odds of guessing correctly outcome of a coin toss is <em>1 in 2</em> and to roll number "6" on a dice-roll is <em>1 in 6</em>.<br> 
        Odds of dying in a motor-vehicle crash is <em>1 in 107</em> and dying from choking on food <em>1 in 2535</em>. To die from lightning stroke you need to beat the odds of <em>1 in 138849</em>. <br>
        But what does it all mean? How easy or hard is to be that un-lucky <em>1 out of...</em>?
        Try this little app and see for yourself.<br>
        Enter a number in the input field and click the
        button. Afterwards try to find hidden red square in the sea of blue
        ones. You only have one chance!<br>
        PS. For inspiration of different odds you can visit <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/preventable-death-overview/odds-of-dying/">this website</a><br>
        PS2. For now it is not really responsive to huge numbers (larger than 100 000). However, it is super unlikely for anything of odds smaller than that to happen to you anyway.
